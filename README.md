# 📊 Social Media Trend Analysis Dashboard

This Power BI project was created as part of my **Data Analytics Internship at Future Intern**, focusing on the analysis of **social media sentiment and engagement trends** across platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.

## 🚀 Objective
To analyze sentiment trends, platform engagement, and regional sentiment variations from a given dataset and convert it into a **visually insightful dashboard**.

---

## ✅ Problem Statement Solved
The dashboard answers the following key business questions:

1. **What is the overall sentiment distribution across social media posts?**
   - Solved using a donut chart visualizing Positive, Neutral, and Negative sentiment proportions.

2. **How does sentiment change over time?**
   - A time series line graph tracks monthly trends in sentiment categories.

3. **How do different platforms compare in terms of sentiment?**
   - A stacked bar chart breaks down sentiment by platform (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram).

4. **Which geographic regions show higher positive or negative sentiment?**
   - A map visual identifies the sentiment intensity by region.

5. **Which platform has higher engagement (likes vs. retweets)?**
   - Two comparative visuals (bubble chart and treemap) show platform-specific engagement metrics.
